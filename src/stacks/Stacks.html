<h2>Stack</h2>
<br/>
<p>
A stack is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called top. 
Stack follows Last In First Out paradigm.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Stack Operations 
</p>
<li>
push(int data): inserts data onto stack
</li>
<li>
int pop(): removes and returns the last inserted data from the stack
</li>
<li>
int peek(): returns the last inserted element without removing it
</li>
<li>
int size(): returns the count of elements in the stack
</li>
<li>
boolean isEmpty(): checks if stack is empty
</li>
<li>
boolean isFull(): checks if stack is full
</li>
<p>
When an element is popped or peeked from an empty stack, EmptyStackException is thrown.
</p>
<p>
Space Complexity:  O(n) to hold n elements 
</p>
<p>
Time Complexity: O(1) for pop, peek, size, isEmpty, isFull, O(1) for push using linkedlist, O(n) for push using dynamic array
</p>

<h4>
1. ImplementStackUsingArrays
</h4>
<p>
Using Static Arrays vs Dynamic Arrays for implementation:
When used static arrays, maximum size of stack must be defined in prior and cannot be changed. 
Item cannot be pushed into a full stack. 
</p>
<p>
When used dynamic arrays, for every push, array size is incremented. 
Instead, when used repeated doubling technique, every time array reaches its max limit, array size is doubled to the existing size. 
Amortized time-complexity to push n elements will be O(n)
</p>
<h4>
2. ImplementStackUsingLinkedList
</h4>
<p>
Push operation is implemented by inserting node at the beginning of the list (head)
Pop operation is implemented by deleting node from the beginning of the list (head)
</p>
